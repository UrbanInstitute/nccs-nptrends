Mark either \u201cyes\u201d that you want to participate (and then you will enter the survey) or \u201cno\u201d that you do not want to participate and you will exit from survey and we will not contact you again for this study.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">SUMMARY OF THE STUDY&nbsp;<\/span><br>\nWe invite you to join a nationwide effort to tell the story of nonprofit organizations in this unprecedented time.  Policymakers and the public, who do not fully understand the needs of nonprofit organizations and how they are coping, are uncertain how to continue to support nonprofits and their stakeholders. Your response will help to provide a reliable, comprehensive portrait of how giving trends and the pandemic have impacted the programs and services nonprofits like you provide to their communities. This information will directly inform strategies, resources, and policies necessary to help nonprofit organizations and their communities to survive and rebuild after the pandemic. The mix of nonprofits invited to participate includes small, medium, and large 501(c)(3) organizations providing all types of services through a variety of funding sources, in rural, suburban, and urban areas in every state. Please respond even if you do not feel that your organization has been or continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(52, 152, 219);\">WHO IS CONDUCTING THIS STUDY<\/span><br>\nResearch partners at George Mason University (a public university in Virginia) and American University (a private university in Washington, DC) are conducting this survey. You may contact us at mkim216@gmu.edu or faulk@american.edu if you have questions or concerns about this project. &nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">COMMITMENT<\/span><br>\nWe hope you will commit to helping us understand your organization\u2019s story, and how it changes over time. We ask you to participate in the survey linked here (about 15-20 minutes of your time). We may invite you to participate in future web-based surveys to capture changes over time and continue to learn more about the important work your organization does through short surveys once or twice per year. You may opt out or request to be taken off the future survey list at any time. To keep surveys as brief as possible, we may collect additional information about your organization from publicly available sources like the IRS Forms 990 that your organization has filed in the past.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">CONFIDENTIALITY<\/span><br>\nNone of the project reports will include the names of participants or their organizations.&nbsp; We will summarize information in various ways to tell the stories of nonprofits from different angles, but we will protect the identities of the participating organizations. The information you provide will be housed in a secure database. De-identified data without information that could be used to identify you or your organization will be made available for noncommercial research through a Creative Commons license. Identifiable data files will be protected in a secure database and made available only to researchers who can demonstrate they are able to maintain the same standards of confidentiality as the project team.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">BENEFITS<\/span><br>\nParticipation in this study may not benefit you personally, but there may be a benefit to your organization. This study contributes to the field by contributing to the most accurate portrayal of the nonprofit charitable organizations to date. This information will provide you and your board with comparable data on the finances, giving trends, and actions of other nonprofits during this pandemic and afterwards. Foundations and other funding agencies will gain timely insights into the issues affecting nonprofits on the ground and will be able to see trends unfolding as we follow-up with the same group of nonprofits over time. <br>\n<br>\nAt the end of the survey, each respondent will be invited to enter his or her organization\u2019s name into a random drawing for one (1) $1,000 donation, which will be drawn from the pool of organization names that all respondents of the survey entered. Once the survey closes, one (1) winner will be notified through email and\/or phone.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">RISKS<\/span><br>\nNone of the publicly available information will include the name of participants or their organizations. We do not anticipate any risks to you or your organization for participating in this study.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION<\/span><br>\nYour participation, and participation of your organization, is entirely voluntary for this study and future follow-up studies. You are free to choose not to participate.&nbsp; Should you choose to participate, you can withdraw at any time without consequences of any kind. You may also refuse to answer any individual question without consequences. At the end of the survey, you will be invited to enter your organization into the $1,000 donation drawing whether you answer each individual question or not.

Your response will help to provide a reliable, comprehensive portrait of how giving trends and the pandemic have impacted the programs and services nonprofits like you provide to their communities. This information will directly inform strategies, resources, and policies necessary to help nonprofit organizations and their communities to survive and rebuild after the pandemic. The mix of nonprofits invited to participate includes small, medium, and large 501(c)(3) organizations providing all types of services through a variety of funding sources, in rural, suburban, and urban areas in every state.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(52, 152, 219);\">WHO IS CONDUCTING THE STUDY<\/span><br>\nThe Urban Institute, a nonprofit nonpartisan research organization in Washington, DC, and its research partners at American University (a private university in Washington, DC) and George Mason University (a public university in Virginia) are conducting this study. You may contact us at <a href=\"mailto:NPSurvey@urban.org\">NPSurvey@urban.org<\/a> if you have questions or concerns about this project. You can learn more about the study team and these organizations on our project web-page at the Urban Institute, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urban.org\/partnering-understand-long-term-trends-nonprofit-organization-activities-and-needs\">https:\/\/www.urban.org\/partnering-understand-long-term-trends-nonprofit-organization-activities-and-needs<\/a>.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">COMMITMENT<\/span><br>\nWe hope you will commit to helping us understand your organization\u2019s story, and how it changes over time. We ask you to participate in the survey linked here (about 15 minutes of your time). We may invite you to participate in future web-based surveys to capture changes over time and continue to learn more about the important work your organization does through short surveys once or twice per year. You may opt out or request to be taken off the future survey list at any time. To keep surveys as brief as possible, we may collect additional information about your organization from publicly available sources like the IRS Forms 990 that your organization has filed in the past.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">CONFIDENTIALITY<\/span><br>\nNone of the project reports will include the names of participants or their organizations.&nbsp; We will summarize information in various ways to tell the stories of nonprofits from different angles, but we will protect the identities of the participating organizations. The information you provide will be housed in a secure database. De-identified data without information that could be used to identify you or your organization will be made available for noncommercial research through a Creative Commons license. Identifiable data files will be protected in a secure database and made available only to researchers who can demonstrate they are able to maintain the same standards of confidentiality as the project team.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">BENEFITS<\/span><br>\nParticipation in this study may not benefit you personally, but there may be a benefit to your organization. This study contributes to the field by contributing to the most accurate portrayal of the nonprofit charitable organizations to date. This information will provide you and your board with comparable data on the finances, giving trends, and actions of other nonprofits during this pandemic and afterwards. Foundations and other funding agencies will gain timely insights into the issues affecting nonprofits on the ground and will be able to see trends unfolding as we follow-up with the same group of nonprofits over time. <br>\n<br>\nAt the end of the survey, each respondent will be invited to enter his or her organization\u2019s name into a random drawing for one (1) $1,000 donation, which will be drawn from the pool of organization names that all respondents of the survey entered (a pool of up to 2,306 organizations). The drawing will take place in September 2023, when one (1) winner will be notified through email and\/or phone.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">RISKS<\/span><br>\nNone of the publicly available information will include the name of participants or their organizations. We do not anticipate any risks to you or your organization for participating in this study.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(41, 128, 185);\">VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION<\/span><br>\nYour participation, and participation of your organization, is entirely voluntary for this study and future follow-up studies. You are free to choose not to participate.&nbsp; Should you choose to participate, you can withdraw at any time without consequences of any kind. You may also refuse to answer any individual question without consequences. At the end of the survey, you will be invited to enter your organization into the $1,000 donation drawing whether you answer each individual question or not.
